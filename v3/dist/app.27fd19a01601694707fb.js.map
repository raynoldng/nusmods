to plan their school timetables.\n            Over time, more features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students.\n            Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves to be a complete knowledge bank of NUS modules\n            by providing useful module-related information such as archived CORS bidding statistics\n            and community-driven module reviews and discussions.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Goals</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            In the long term, NUSMods strives to enhance the quality of students&apos;\n            lives in school by serving as a one-stop platform that provides useful\n            utility tools and an avenue for students to share their knowledge and experiences.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            As an app built by students for students,\n            NUSMods hopes to encourage fellow students to experiment and create original,\n            community-engaging work that also improves the lives of NUS students.\n            Examples of such initiatives are\n            <a href=\"http://cloudsync.ivle.nus.edu.sg/\"> IVLE Cloud Sync </a>\n            and\n            <a href=\"http://www.corspedia.com/\"> Corspedia </a>\n            (which has been integrated into NUSMods as of July 2014).\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Connect with Us!</h3>\n\n          <p>\n

This is equivalent\n           to 24 * 5\n          * 2 = 240 slots. This is to account for lessons that are on alternating weeks. For example,\n           a lecture that is from 8-10\n          every Monday would map to [8, 9, 128, 129].</p>\n          <p>Each module is represented by a Boolean selector variable, which is\n          true in the model returned by z3 if its\n           in the timetable. For each module, we extract its lesson types\n           (lecture, tutorial, sectional, recitation etc.).\n            Due to the fact that different modules have different lesson types, and each lesson type\n            can have varying\n            hours, we have (integer) variables for each contact hour (per fortnight)\n            in the module. For example, a CS2020\n            tutorial with 4 hours every 2 weeks will have the variables CS2020_Tut0, ...,  CS2020_Tut3. These\n             variables will help us check for timetable clashes. We\n            then have boolean selector variables CS2020_Tut_0, ..., CS2020_Tut_10 (exactly one of which\n              will be true) to force the\n            integer variables into the hours corresponding to the slot timing.</p>\n          <h2>Free Day Queries</h2>\n          <p>We shall discuss how the free day query is composed.

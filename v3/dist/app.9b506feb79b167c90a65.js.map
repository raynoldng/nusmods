The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

We have, and are in the midst of adding\n            some of these new features, but several design decisions preclude us from implementing some others.\n            The section below explains our general philosophy when designing this app, via explanations on why\n            specific features were not implemented.\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><p>Flexibility in blocking out hourly slots</p></li>\n            <p>\n              We actually successfully implemented both the interface and back-end logic for this, but decided to\n              exclude it from the alpha-release as it resulted in a cluttered timetable interface and was unintuitive\n              to use. The gains by introducing this was also very small - in general we believe that students will\n              not need such fine-grained control, locking slots in place or playing around with the optional modules\n              list should be more than enough.\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Display past bidding stats for different lesson slots</p></li>\n            <p>\n              Even though the data is publicly avaiable, we want to try to keep the application as minimalistic as\n              possible, and feel that the added convenience this feature would yield is not worth the decline in\n              general user experience.\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Display all possible timetables satisfying a given constraint list</p></li>\n            <p>\n              This is a rather oft-repeated request, but it is computationally impractical to implement. The reason\n              why this application is so fast despite having so many options is that we are using a super efficient\n              <a href=\"http://fmv.jku.at/boolector/\"> SMT solver</a> which is good at finding a single model\n              (solution), but not-so-good at generating distinct solutions. However, we understand having multiple\n              timetables to choose from would be useful for bidding, and hence made timetable generation\n              as non-deterministic (random) as possible. Just spam the Generate Timetable button a few times until\n              you get one that suits you.\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Allow setting of priorities to options and optional modules</p></li>\n            <p>\n              Once again, we think that the tradeoff between such fine-grained control and performance/usability\n              is not worth it, especially when users can manually do this with what they have now (include the\n              options with highest priority first, and if that fails, replace with the next set of options).\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Show all GE mods from a particular pillar that fit in a timetable</p></li>\n            <p>\n              Although this is a very valid concern, we do not have the computational power to do this, and\n              users who want to clear modules from particular GE pillars are advised to add the most interesting\n              GE modules in the optional section and try to generate a timetable, failing which add the next few\n              most interesting mods and so on.\n            </p>\n          </ul>\n\n          <p>\n            In summary, proposed features are sometimes not implemented due to design tradeoffs, lack of computational\n            power, and priorities.

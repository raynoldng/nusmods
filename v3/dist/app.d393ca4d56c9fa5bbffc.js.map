to plan their school timetables.\n            Over time, more features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students.\n            Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves to be a complete knowledge bank of NUS modules\n            by providing useful module-related information such as archived CORS bidding statistics\n            and community-driven module reviews and discussions.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Goals</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            In the long term, NUSMods strives to enhance the quality of students&apos;\n            lives in school by serving as a one-stop platform that provides useful\n            utility tools and an avenue for students to share their knowledge and experiences.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            As an app built by students for students,\n            NUSMods hopes to encourage fellow students to experiment and create original,\n            community-engaging work that also improves the lives of NUS students.\n            Examples of such initiatives are\n            <a href=\"http://cloudsync.ivle.nus.edu.sg/\"> IVLE Cloud Sync </a>\n            and\n            <a href=\"http://www.corspedia.com/\"> Corspedia </a>\n            (which has been integrated into NUSMods as of July 2014).\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Connect with Us!</h3>\n\n          <p>\n

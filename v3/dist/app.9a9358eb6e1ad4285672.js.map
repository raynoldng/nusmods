history</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            NUS Modifications (NUSMods) was founded in 2012 by\n            <a href=\"http://benghee.eu/\"> Beng </a>\n            to provide a better way for students to plan their school timetables.\n            Over time, more features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students.\n            Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves to be a complete knowledge bank of NUS modules\n            by providing useful module-related information such as archived CORS bidding statistics\n            and community-driven module reviews and discussions.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Goals</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            In the long term, NUSMods strives to enhance the quality of students&apos;\n            lives in school by serving as a one-stop platform that provides useful\n            utility tools and an avenue for students to share their knowledge and experiences.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            As an app built by students for students,\n            NUSMods hopes to encourage fellow students to experiment and create original,\n            community-engaging work that also improves the lives of NUS students.\n            Examples of such initiatives are\n            <a href=\"http://cloudsync.ivle.nus.edu.sg/\"> IVLE Cloud Sync </a>\n            and\n            <a href=\"http://www.corspedia.com/\"> Corspedia </a>\n            (which has been integrated into NUSMods as of July 2014).\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Connect with Us!</h3>\n\n          <p>\n

mobile-friendly. Since we intend to integrate our auto-build feature eventually\n            with the main site, we have chosen to adopt their philosophy as well.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A possibility to look into in future would be to have a Legacy Mode button, but that is not our main\n            priority right now\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>Why is this particular feature not implemented?</h4>\n          <p>\n            After our first round of testing, we have received a lot of feedback, including requests to implement\n            various additional features that may be useful to students. We have, and are in the midst of adding\n            some of these new features, but several design decisions preclude us from implementing some others.\n            The section below explains our general philosophy when designing this app, via explanations on why\n            specific features were not implemented.\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><p>Flexibility in blocking out hourly slots</p></li>\n            <p>\n              We actually successfully implemented both the interface and back-end logic for this, but decided to\n              exclude it from the alpha-release as it resulted in a cluttered timetable interface and was unintuitive\n              to use. The gains by introducing this was also very small - in general we believe that students will\n              not need such fine-grained control, locking slots in place or playing around with the optional modules\n              list should be more than enough.\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Display past bidding stats for different lesson slots</p></li>\n            <p>\n              Even though the data is publicly avaiable, we want to try to keep the application as minimalistic as\n              possible, and feel that the added convenience this feature would yield is not worth the decline in\n              general user experience.\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Display all possible timetables satisfying a given constraint list</p></li>\n            <p>\n              This is a rather oft-repeated request, but it is computationally impractical to implement. The reason\n              why this application is so fast despite having so many options is that we are using a super efficient\n              <a href=\"http://fmv.jku.at/boolector/\"> SMT solver</a> which is good at finding a single model\n              (solution), but not-so-good at generating distinct solutions. However, we understand having multiple\n              timetables to choose from would be useful for bidding, and hence made timetable generation\n              as non-deterministic (random) as possible. Just spam the Generate Timetable button a few times until\n              you get one that suits you.\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Allow setting of priorities to options and optional modules</p></li>\n            <p>\n              Once again, we think that the tradeoff between such fine-grained control and performance/usability\n              is not worth it, especially when users can manually do this with what they have now (include the\n              options with highest priority first, and if that fails, replace with the next set of options).\n            </p>\n            <li><p>Show all GE mods from a particular pillar that fit in a timetable</p></li>\n            <p>\n              Although this is a very valid concern, we do not have the computational power to do this, and\n              users who want to clear modules from particular GE pillars are advised to add the most interesting\n              GE modules in the optional section and try to generate a timetable, failing which add the next few\n              most interesting mods and so on.\n            </p>\n          </ul>\n\n          <p>\n            In summary, proposed features are sometimes not implemented due to design tradeoffs, lack of computational\n            power, and priorities. If you think you have some feature that is feasible and useful to a large\n            proportion of the student population, feel free to email bayweiheng@gmail.com or raynold.ng24@gmail.com\n            (include NUSMods Auto-build in the subject).\n          </p>\n          {/* <h4>Here&#39;s what we <em>have</em> implemented:</h4>\n          <ul>\n            <li><p>Button to switch modules from compulsory to optional and vice versa</p></li>\n            <li><p>Button to remove all compulosry/optional modules at once</p></li>\n            <li><p>Allow specifying of preferred weekdays when selecting free day option</p></li>\n          </ul>*/}\n\n          <h4>Can you go back to the previous color scheme?

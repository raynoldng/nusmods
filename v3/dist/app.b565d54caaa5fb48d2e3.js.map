The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

history</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            NUS Modifications (NUSMods) was founded in 2012 by\n            <a href=\"http://benghee.eu/\"> Beng </a>\n            to provide a better way for students to plan their school timetables.\n            Over time, more features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students.\n            Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves to be a complete knowledge bank of NUS modules\n            by providing useful module-related information such as archived CORS bidding statistics\n            and community-driven module reviews and discussions.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Goals</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            In the long term, NUSMods strives to enhance the quality of students&apos;\n            lives in school by serving as a one-stop platform that provides useful\n            utility tools and an avenue for students to share their knowledge and experiences.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            As an app built by students for students,\n            NUSMods hopes to encourage fellow students to experiment and create original,\n            community-engaging work that also improves the lives of NUS students.\n            Examples of such initiatives are\n            <a href=\"http://cloudsync.ivle.nus.edu.sg/\"> IVLE Cloud Sync </a>\n            and\n            <a href=\"http://www.corspedia.com/\"> Corspedia </a>\n            (which has been integrated into NUSMods as of July 2014).\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Connect with Us!</h3>\n\n          <p>\n
